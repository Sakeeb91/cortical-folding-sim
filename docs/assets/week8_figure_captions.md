# Week 8 Figure Captions

1. `docs/assets/week3_anisotropy_delta.png`
   Directional growth anisotropy changes fold morphology relative to isotropic growth (delta GI=1.2515, delta curvature p90=-0.4493).
2. `docs/assets/week4_collision_ablation.png`
   Spatial-hash collision handling reduces overlap-count outliers versus sampled collision checks (delta overlap count=15.0) while remaining within runtime budget.
3. `docs/assets/week5_layered_ablation.png`
   Layered approximation improves GI and reduces skull penetration fraction on the reference setting (delta GI=0.0911, delta outside skull frac=-0.0062).
4. `docs/assets/week7_baseline_vs_improved.gif`
   Deterministic baseline-vs-improved animation comparison from a shared source pipeline (delta GI=0.0911, delta disp p95=-0.0011).
